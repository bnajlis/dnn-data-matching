This is the code for "Recurrent Neural Networks - The Math of Intelligence (Week 5)" By Siraj Raval on Youtube

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/BwmddtPFWtA) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval as part of The Math of Intelligence series. It's a simple numpy implementation of a recurrent network that can read in a sequence of words and then generate words in that style. We train it on Franz Kafka here. 

## Dependencies

* numpy

Install missing ependencies with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). 

## Usage
